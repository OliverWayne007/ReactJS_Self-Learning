Ans: 

Question: Why is fetching "react" and "react-dom" from CDN to inject the React library into our code not a preferred way to use React ?

Ans: This because of the following reasons:

1. In order to use react, we would need to make network calls to the CDN which is slower.

2. If we want to change the version of React, we would need to hit a different URL which makes it difficult to manage.

3. If we intall the entire React library which is hosted on npm using "npm install react", then the react code will be 
   available in the node_modules folder and as a dependency in the package.json file which would make it easier to manage
   as we would be able to easily update the versions using "npm update" without changing the URL in the src attribute of the
   script tag in the index.html file.
