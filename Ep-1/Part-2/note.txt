In part-2, we fetch the react code into our html file from the CDN to get react into our code.

In order to get react in our code we fetch the following two javascript files from the CDN:
1. "https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"
2. "https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"

Note that react is nothing but some javascript code written by some really smart developers at facebook/meta.

1. "https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"

"react" library provides the core functionality of react, such as:
----> components
----> State Management
----> Hooks
----> Rendering the React virtual DOM

"react" library contains the declarative API for building user interfaces, but it does not include anything related to 
rendering the components to the actual DOM or platform-specific logic.

"react" library is platform-agnostic.

2. "https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"

----> "react-dom" library is specifically used for rendering React components to the web  browser's DOM.

----> It bridges the gap between React's virtual DOM and the browser's actual DOM.

----> "react-dom" is only needed when working with the web. For other platforms such as mobile, react-dom is not required.
----> In case of mobile, React Native is used.

----> Unlike the "react" library which is platform-agnostic, "react-dom" library is platform-specific.
