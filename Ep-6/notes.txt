Question: When are the useEffect-Hooks executed ?

Ans: The callback functions in useEffect hooks are executed after the DOM update and rendering phase is completed. 
     This ensures that React has fully updated the DOM before running the useEffect hooks.


Question: What is the order of execution of the callback functions present in different useEffect-Hooks in the code ?
    
Ans: Order of Execution of useEffect Callbacks:

Render Phase:
The component is rendered, and console.log("App component is rendered..."); is executed.

Commit Phase (after rendering):
The useEffect callbacks are executed in the order they are defined in the code. This means that the callback functions of
the different useEffect-Hooks present in the code are executed in the same order in which the useEffect-Hooks are defined
in the code. This order remains the same on every re-render of the component.
